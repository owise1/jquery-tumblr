# jquery-tumblr

jquery-tumblr is a plugin that parses a tumblr feed and outputs markup.

It was inspired by the work of [Chris Tran](https://chris-tran.com/blog/?p=236) however realy bares no resemblance to his code.

Note that the markup generated is similar to that of tumblr's default theme however posts are enclosed in ul/li tags rather than just div's.

## Example

```html
<div id="loading">Loading...</div>
<div id="posts"></div>
<div id="pagination"></div>
	<script type="text/javascript">
	$(document).ready(function () {
		$('#posts')
			.tumblr({
				url:        'http://blog.thehiddenventure.com',
				pagination: '#pagination',
				loading:    '#loading'
			});
	});
	</script>
```

## Url

You must the url of your tumblr blog. Note that if you have set a custom domain in tumblr, you should use this as the value you set.

- url: your tumblr url (ie. http://(YOUR NAME).tumblr.com or http://(YOUR NAME CUSTOM DOMAIN).com )

- [jquery-timeago](http://timeago.yarp.com/) - is needed if the timeago option is true (default).
